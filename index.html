            <p>
                Founded in 1948 by Vittorio Bertazzoni as an enameling and metalworking company, 
                the Smeg company preserves the memory of the activity originally carried out in the acronym 
                Smalterie Metallurgiche Emiliane Guastalla. 
            </p>
            <p>During the 1950s the companyâ€™s metalworking background was accompanied by the production of its 
                first cooking appliances. In 1956, the company presented "Elisabeth", one of the first gas 
                cookers equipped with automatic ignition, a safety valve in the oven and a cooking programmer.
            </p>
            <p>In the 1960s, Smeg introduced its first ever washing machine, the Leda, and then introduced the 
                60 cm Niagara dishwasher, known for its unprecedented load capacity of 14 place settings.
                In 1971, the company began the production of built-in hobs and ovens.
